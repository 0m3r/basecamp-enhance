# basecamp-enhance

## Instalation

1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:0m3r/basecamp-enhance.git

```

2. Install chrome extension
Let’s install the extension. Open Chrome and enter `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar. You should see a page displaying the extensions you’ve installed.
As we want to install our extension from a file (and not the Chrome Web Store) we need to activate Developer mode using the toggle in the top right-hand corner of the page. This should add an extra menu bar with the option Load unpacked. Click this button and select the `basecamp-enhance` folder you created previously. Click Open and the extension will be installed.

3. Open basecamp to-do. Copy FTPs.
4. Now you can copy ftps link on FileZilla Quickconnect bar. Once you click Quickconnect button, the URL is parsed into Host, Username, Password and Port.
